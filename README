This is a plug and play device controller that sits between a FREEDM DESD and
the DGI. It is connected directly to a DESD via serial line. It implements the
client side of the DGI's plug and play protocol, which is defined at [1]. It
translates the DGI's power level command into the DESD's native format, and
the DESD's actual power level from the DESD's format into a state message to the
DGI.

The current version of the DGI, 1.6, does not know how to handle DESDs very
well. Therefore, we intentionally pretend to be an SST instead. Likely this will
need to be changed to remain compatible with the upcoming DGI 1.7.
